/// `AutomationTriggerType` declares five triggers — manual, scheduled, onStartup, onSessionCreated,
/// fileWatch. Before this file, exactly one of them ran anything, and only because the user pressed
/// a button. The other four were an enum, an icon and a display name. The Automations screen drew
/// "Next run: Tomorrow at 9:00 AM" from a string-matching heuristic and nothing ever came.
///
/// Four rules this scheduler keeps, each of them a way the naive version goes wrong:
///
/// 1. **No catch-up storms.** Next fire is computed from `lastRunAt`, and firing sets `lastRunAt`
///    to now. An app closed over a weekend comes back to one overdue run of an hourly automation,
///    not forty-eight.
/// 2. **No overlap.** An automation already running is not started again, and runs are serialised
///    against each other. A local model serves one turn at a time; two concurrent turns would
///    queue inside MLX and land as one mysterious stall.
/// 3. **Never over the user.** While a chat turn is generating, due automations wait for the next
///    tick. The user's turn is the one with someone watching it.
/// 4. **A run that fails is recorded as failed.** `recordAutomationRun` is the only writer of
///    `lastStatus`, so a schedule cannot report success for a turn that refused.
